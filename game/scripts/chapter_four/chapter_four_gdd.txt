Play as Matt w/ Ocho


4 Acts (+1 from Chapter3)


Each Act should have simpler mechanics so it isn't front/back-loaded
Top right of the screen is just the current time w/ time until tourney

Acts:
1. Introduction: Matt has to make lunch to prepare for his tourney at the LGS (no doxx sir)
2. Rising Action: Matt goes to work, the gym, the flipino land,etc (FILLER EXDE)
3. Climax: Matt vs Trip
4. Falling Action: Celebration 

after celebration, bad things happen, Cody w/ friends just starts killing everyone (idk inverting everyone so we get Evil thang, Evil Matt) then the building collapses end of chapter :)





Ideas for Matt vs Trip

1. Hella Quick Time Events (QTE)
2. Option Select
3. Make it an IRL fight
4. Trip gets into an accident so there is just no fight
5. Combine option Select + QTE
6. Idk have some sort of a flashback
